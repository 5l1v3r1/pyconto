Algorithms / Datastructures / Databases / Visualization

Subclasses:
    - Hypergraph with Hyperedges
    - Hierarchical Network (non-overlapping and overlapping / covers)
    - Cariani Network
    - Connectome Network
    - Dynamic Network
    - Time-Delayed Network (Time-Duration Network)
    - Layered Network (representing a structural and a functional graph with node identities)
    
Functions: (answer questions: do copy (preserve data) or work inplace)
    IO:
    - parse_graphml / from_graphml / write_graphml
    - from_matrix / to_matrix
    - pickle
    
    Visualization:
    - layouting algorithms
    
    Pipeline:
    - symmetrize (type: sum, avg, abs_difference, max, min, geom_avg)
    - binarize
    - get_largest_connected_component (or smallest)
    - get_min / get_max value of nodes attr / edges attr
    - threshold (return connectedness)
    
    Measures:
    - small_worldness
    - scale_freeness
    
    Plotting:
    - produce standard plots
    - degree distribution
    - weight distributions (with variable binning sizes)
    
    Others:
    - slice a dynamical array -> returns a static array with correct attributes
    - initialize from data or using a generative algorithm
    - fitting model to data
    - employing caching mechanism similar to nitime for attributes (directed etc.) that need some computation
      possbility to invalidate (e.g. when application of particular algorithms that change them)
