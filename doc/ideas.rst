the fluctuations represent neuronal avalanches, which are spatio-temporal clusters
of synchronized activity that follow a power law in size distributions as expected
for systems in the critical state.

hypergraphs
A hypergraph is an abstract mathematical structure (Bollobas, 1998), which consists of
objects called Vertices and objects called Edges, which connect the Vertices...

Dynamical complexity in small-world networks of spiking neurons.

A computer model is described which is used to assess the dynamical complexity of a class of networks of spiking neurons with small-world properties. Networks are constructed by forming an initially segregated set of highly intraconnected clusters and then applying a probabilistic rewiring method reminiscent of the Watts-Strogatz procedure to make intercluster connections. Causal density, which counts the number of independent significant interactions among a system's components, is used to assess dynamical complexity. This measure was chosen because it employs lagged observations, and is therefore more sensitive to temporally smeared evidence of segregation and integration than its alternatives. The results broadly support the hypothesis that small-world topology promotes dynamical complexity, but reveal a narrow parameter range within which this occurs for the network topology under investigation, and suggest an inverse correlation with phase synchrony inside this range.

Dynamic phenotypes: time series analysis techniques for characterizing neuronal and behavioral dynamics.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16595862?dopt=Abstract

Most current models of neural network dynamics
focus on maintaining the right balance of network activation and rest through functional interactions
among populations of inhibitory and excitatory nodes (Beggs and Plenz, 2003). Alternative balancing
mechanisms may be provided by broad external input from neuromodulatory systems or self-sustained
neuronal activity (Muresan and Savin, 2007). However, the topology of neural networks may also
contribute to critical network dynamics, even in the absence of explicit inhibition. For this reason, we
are particularly interested in the relationship of different kinds of neural network topology to the
condition of limited sustained activation (LSA).
