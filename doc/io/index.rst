Network IO from disk-stored files
---------------------------------
- Reader/Writers, from NetworkX
- Skip header lines for text files

adjacency matrix, pairs file, GraphML

Should PyConTo handle very large networks?
Yes. (This has implications on the data structures and algorithms to use.)


Database backend?

Interfaces to other tools, Packages
-----------------------------------

NetworkInterfacer
- e.g. can handle references of objects to other applications, packages
neuron simulator (PyNN) objects, protein-protein (biological) networks,
NetworkX graph object

Interacing with Connectome File Format, e.g. export functionality
