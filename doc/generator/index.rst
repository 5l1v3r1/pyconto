* Generating networks with arbitrary hierarchical structure

As a modest proposal, I suggest that hierarchical random graphs  (HRGs) seem to serve as a more robust null-model, since they can capture a wide range of the heterogeneity that we observe in the real-world, e.g., community structure, skewed degree distribution, high clustering coefficient, etc.
