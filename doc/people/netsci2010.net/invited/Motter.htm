<p class=MsoPlainText>Genetic diseases, ecosystem collapses, cascading failures, network synchronization, materials sign. These are some of the many outstanding interdisciplinary problems that could benefit from a predictive modeling approach to control the perturbation response of complex systems. The main obstacle to the development of such an approach has been that it is generally unclear how the large-scale collective behavior is affected by the local properties of the underlying interaction networks. In this presentation I will discuss an alternative approach that is currently being developed, which is based on inverting this perspective and seeking instead the conditions that should be imposed on the local network structure and/or dynamics to generate a desired collective behavior. This approach has been used to predict, for example, that a faulty metabolic network can be rescued by the targeted removal of genes -- the exact opposite of what traditional gene therapy would suggest. Predictions go as far as to assert that certain gene deletions can restore the growth of otherwise nonviable gene-deficient cells, an effect now known as synthetic rescue. I will also discuss several other possible applications, ranging from cascade control and network stabilization to the design of materials with negative compressibility. I thus hope to convey that, besides helping explain why "less can be more", these concepts lead to a framework that can be used to systematically control and harness network response in numerous complex systems.
