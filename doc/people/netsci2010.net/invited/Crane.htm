<p class=MsoPlainText>On December 5th 2009, DARPA offered a $40,000 prize to the first person to report the whereabouts of 10 moored red weather balloons at undisclosed locations throughout the U.S.; a problem the intelligence community considered impossible to solve.  DARPA—the Department of Defense agency that built the precursor to the modern-day Internet—issued the challenge as a way of celebrating the 40th anniversary of that achievement. Over those 40 years, the Internet has emerged as a global system linking nearly all the world's computers, as well as the Web, which today links nearly all the world's publicly available information.  
There is a current transformation being driven by the convergence of new Web technologies linking people, combined with new mobile technologies linking things and places as well. This new landscape, powered by ubiquitous computing, sensors, smartphones, and social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, is transforming our ability to rapidly mobilize populations. In this talk, I will describe how our team utilized social media and social networks to build an instantaneous crowd --- in the course of only 36 hours --- that was able to effectively search the continental US and find the locations of all 10 balloons in 8 hours and 52 minutes.</p>
