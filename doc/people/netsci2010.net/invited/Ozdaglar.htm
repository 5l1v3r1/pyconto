<p class=MsoPlainText>Interconnections across firms linked through supply networks or financial linkages might create cascades as shocks to some firms spread to the rest of the economy. In this paper, we provide a general framework for the analysis of the relationship between the network structure of an economy and its aggregate volatility. An economy consists of a set of firms linked through a supply (input-output) network, which specifies how much the output of each firm matters in the production of other firms. We define aggregate volatility as the variance of the average of log outputs in the economy, and study the relationship between firm-level volatility and aggregate volatility as a function of the structural properties of the supply network. We consider a sequence of economies (in which the number of firms grows) and investigate whether and at what rate aggregate volatility disappears. First, we show that when the supply network is star-like, meaning that there exists firms that supply a non-vanishing fraction of the economy, the weak law of large numbers fails and aggregate volatility does not disappear. This case starkly illustrates how aggregate fluctuations may result from purely idiosyncratic (firm-level) variability. Our main focus, however, is with sequences of economies for which the weak law of large numbers holds. When the network structure is fully connected (with each firm purchasing inputs from all others) or corresponds to a structure where each firm supplies a few others (or there exists a uniform bound on the output-degree of each firm in the supply network),  aggregate volatility declines asymptotically at the rate $1/\sqrt {n}$, consistent with the weak law of large numbers. In this case, in reasonable-sized economies, firm-level shocks wash out rapidly. However, in the presence of richer network interactions, the rate of convergence can be significantly lower (and convergence is not necessarily to a normal distribution). 

Our most important results provide various lower bounds on the rate of convergence of aggregate volatility as the size of the economy grows. A first bound is provided by analyzing the effects of first-order connections, represented by the degree distribution induced by the supply network. This lower bound is in terms of the coefficients of variation of the degree distribution. An immediate corollary of this result is that for degree distributions that exhibit a power law (meaning that the tail of the degree distribution is Pareto), the lower bound can be characterized in terms of the shape parameter of the Pareto distribution. A second and more useful bound is provided by analyzing the effects of second-order (or higher-order) connections, which more closely correspond to the idea of cascades. Here the lower bound is in terms of two-hop ahead connections, for example, capturing whether two highly connected firms also share common suppliers, so that when these suppliers are hit by negative shocks, there is a cascade in the supply network, having an amplified impact on aggregate volatility.
