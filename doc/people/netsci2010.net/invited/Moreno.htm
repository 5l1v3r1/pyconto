<p class=MsoPlainText>In this Conference, being it the first lecture of the School, I will introduce the subject of Complex Networks. First, we will discuss several real-world systems whose structure is better represented by the map of interactions between the system's elements.  Next, the basic definitions, both at local and global scales, used in network theory will be introduced. We shall also present some elements of percolation theory that will be later used to discuss the formation of networks and aspects of their robustness and resilience as well as of the dynamics of spreading processes. Finally, in the last part of the lecture, I will introduce other metrics and processes that will be discussed more deeply by other lecturers. This includes community detection, motifs, diverse kinds of correlations, as well as other properties of the connectivity and Laplacian matrices.
