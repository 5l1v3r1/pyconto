<p class=MsoPlainText>The Impact of Interacting Network Structure</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The majority of recent work in network theory has dealt with individual networks treated as isolated systems. However, many networks are actually just one component in a much larger complex system; such a system can bring together multiple networks with distinct topologies and functions. For instance, modern critical infrastructure spans assorted electric grids, telecom and computer networks, and transportation networks; likewise, a product development project brings together social networks and technical networks to form a system exhibiting so-called socio-technical congruence. Individual networks are increasingly interdependent and previously neglected or "hidden" inter-network connections can significantly impact our understanding of network structure. We develop a mathematical formalism for interacting networks focusing on both intra- and inter-network connectivity properties. With this formalism we show that the critical threshold for the onset of large-scale network connectivity in one network, i.e., the formation of a giant connected component, can be manipulated by the introduction of a multiple network framework. Applications of this work relate to our understanding of disease spreading across geographic regions and how to engineer minimalist communications networks.</p>
