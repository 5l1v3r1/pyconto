<p class=MsoPlainText>How do national identities evolve? By using data of the digital archive of The New York Times, we propose a news-based approach to grasp the main perceived conceptual components of a nation’s identity. Following recent advances in semantic similarity measures, we analyze nation’s news as a component of a bipartite network that relates news to concepts. Aggregating news at nation level, we construct the Identity Space: the nation’s projection of the bipartite network Nation-Concept. Results reveal a dual perspective. On the one hand, most of the nations tend to be described by a relatively stable set of concept across time, albeit epochal moments produce structural changes. On the other hand, the Nation-Nation network – the Identity Space - is characterized by important topological changes in the centrality and connectivity across the 20th century. This network perspective is coherent with two of the most important attributes of national identity: temporal persistence, and progressive differentiation of a nation in the international community.</p>
