<p class=MsoPlainText>Complex technological networks usually present distinct characteristics that strongly affect some of its properties. One of them is the fact that the dynamical processes that develop in these networks are usually along predefined pathways, with limited capabilities of seeking alternative routes.[1] One example of such networks are the highly interconnected systems that provide support to operations and business in large organisations, such as companies or corporations [3]. Known as Operational Support Systems (OSS) and Business Support Systems (BSS), these networked systems sustent most activities in large organisations. In the present work, we propose a simple model to describe the global characteristics of this kind of dynamical interacting processes, where interactions are described as zero-sum games between node pairs. We compute two metrics that describe the global regimes developed by the model, network efficiency and responsive node ratio. We show, for a load capacity m = 1, as the value b, payoff matrix load parameter, increases the efficiency decreases for the three network sizes studied d. It is worth noting the plateau observed between b = [0.5; 0.9] in all three cases. Small density networks seem to be on average more efficient. We also observe a case where for a large density network (d = 10) the efficiency E is slightly higher than some lower density networks (d = 5), for sufficiently large b values (b > 0.4). Additionally, we measured the effect of the load threshold m. We show the efficiency E considering three values of load threshold m = [0.8; 1.0; 1.2]. Clearly a high value of m allows high efficiencies when high values of b are operating in the network. However, the extreme values of efficiency and the plateau value are the same for all cases. In order to analyze the effect of the network density on the efficiency, we computed the number of responsive nodes Nr (divided by the total number of nodes N for normalization purposes), for different values of process density, while maintaining the load value b constant. We show the average of Nr/N, where it can be seen that for small density networks there is always a high ratio of receptive nodes. This ratio tends to decrease as the density of the process network increases,as expected. However, for d ? 4, the model displays a pseudooscillation between two regimes, one of them characterized by a high ratio of blocked nodes and the other one characterized by a high ratio of receptive nodes. Finally, the difference in efficiency of both regimes is larger for denser networks, becoming a (nearly) fully-blocked/fully-responsive network for d > 10. We have presented a simple model of fixed-path dynamical processes in a organization network which has the simplicity and flexibility to depict many interesting situations.
