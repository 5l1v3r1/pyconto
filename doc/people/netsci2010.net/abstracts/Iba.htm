<p class=MsoPlainText>We present a new general technique to understand dynamics of a system and our discoveries in the exploration of several systems. In presented technique, we build a directed network by connecting between nodes according to the sequential order of occurrence. For example, the nexus of communication is described as sequential collaboration network, where each collaborator is drawn as a node, and the nexus of communication is drawn as a link between the nodes. Using the technique, we can analyze the global property of the system’s dynamics, coding its temporal feature into a network representation. In this presentation, we also show a result of mathematical analyses for typical features of sequential networks.</p>
