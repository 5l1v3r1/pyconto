<p class=MsoPlainText>Most of the clinical trials fail because of drug side effects. Predicting drug side effects are very important to avoid toxicity in the early stage. This study tries to analyze drug side effects based on their protein targets. A protein target network was constructed based on their adverse drug reaction similarities. Proteins that belong to the same pathways or the same protein families are shown to have more similar side effect profiles.</p>
