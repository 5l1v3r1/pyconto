<p class=MsoPlainText>In this talk, I will give an overview of network modeling for unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. In unstructured P2P networks, the overlay topology (or connectivity graph) among peers is a crucial component in addition to the peer/data organization and search. Topological characteristics have profound impact on the efficiency of a search on such unstructured P2P networks, as well as other networks. A key limitation of scale-free (power-law) topologies is the high load (i.e., high degree) on a very few number of hub nodes. In a typical unstructured P2P network, peers are not willing to maintain high degrees/loads as they may not want to store a large number of entries for construction of the overlay topology. Therefore, to achieve fairness and practicality among all peers, hard cutoffs on the number of entries are imposed by the individual peers. I will explain the effect of hard cutoff on the topology and search performance. I will also discuss some new topology generation algorithms for unstructured P2P networks.</p>
