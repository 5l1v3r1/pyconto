<p class=MsoPlainText>Most social networks studied in the complex networks literature are undirected, as they are based on reciprocal social interactions. There are however a number of directed social networks, in which the direction signifies a transfer of trust or benefits between individuals. In recent work we have shown that a set of clustering coefficients defined for directed networks reveals a distinct signature for these directed social networks, which sets them apart from other types of directed networks. Here we expand upon this work, and develop a theoretical model for the prediction of these topological features. Using this model can give us a deeper insight into the formation and growth of directed social networks.</p>
