<p class=MsoPlainText>We introduce a methodology to build a network where a link between two nodes exists if the variables associated to the nodes display a co-occurrence which is statistically significant with respect to some null hypothesis. When applied to systems in which elements can be described by categoric variables, this method creates a network where each link both qualifies and quantifies the type of statistically significant interaction between two nodes. More specifically, suppose to have a set of N elements. Each element is monitored by T synchronous samplings of the N categoric variables taking values from a finite alphabet of M symbols. For each pair of elements and for each combination (with repetition) of two symbols we statistically validate the co-occurrence of these symbols in the two series against the null hypothesis of random co-occurrence. This means that for each pair of elements we perform M^2 statistical tests. The statistical validation is obtained by computing the p value from the hypergeometric distribution. The statistical significance is assessed with multiple hypothesis testing either by using the false discovery rate or the Bonferroni correction. The proposed method generates a network of N nodes. Each link has a label which summarizes the statistical significant symbol co-occurrences between the two nodes. The application of widely used community detection algorithms, such as for example the INFOMAP and the extremal optimization of modularity, allows to clearly identify the community structure of nodes. We apply the method to three systems. The first system is the set of actors and movies recorded in the IMDB database. Here we consider i) the co-occurrence of actor pairs in the same movies, to construct the network of actors, and ii) the co-occurrence of movie pairs in the actor career, to construct the network of movies. Our networks displays relatively small communities of actors and movies typically homogeneous with respect to the genre. The second set is composed by 100 highly liquid stocks traded in US equity markets. For each stock we identify days of large positive and negative return with respect to the volatility, and we accordingly discretize returns. Our method performs very well in identifying stocks belonging to the same economic sector and subsector of activity, when we only select diagonal interactions, i.e. interactions describing a similar behavior of stocks. Our method also reveal a large number of non diagonal interactions, i.e. interactions describing opposite behavior of stocks, probably associated with portfolio balancing and/or pair trading activity. The third set is composed by all Finnish and foreign investors of Nokia stock. Each variable is associated with the trading activity of an investor during the period in which she was active in the market. More precisely, we use an alphabet describing whether the investor mainly buy, sell, or performs both activities in a given day. In this case our method identifies clusters of investors with a very high level of synchronization both in time and type of trading activity.</p>
