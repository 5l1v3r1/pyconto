<p class=MsoPlainText>We study the dynamical properties of the propagation of innovation on complex networks. In order to investigate the diversity of technological level, we study the scaling property of width, $W(N,t)$, which represents the mean-square-root of the technological level of agents. Here, $N$ is the total number of agents. From the numerical simulations, we find that the steady-state value of $W(N,t)$, $W_{sat}(N)$, scales as$W_{sat}(N)\sim N^{-1/2}$ when the system is in a {\it flat ordered phase} for $d\ge 2$. In the {\it flat ordered phase}, most of the agents have the same technological level. On the other hand when the system is in a {\it smooth disordered phase}, the value of $W_{sat}(N)$ does not depend on $N$. For the comparison, we also measure $W(N,t)$ on regular lattices. The results provides an evidence that the upper critical dimension for the roughening transition of the propagation of innovation is $d_u=2$.</p>
