<p class=MsoPlainText>We know that different ideas, knowledge, and information spread at differing speeds and to different extents through society. In this work, we perform a careful study of this phenomenon in the Twitter online network. Our investigation considers information propagation in three ways: information classes, user classes, and community structure. First, we seek to identify classes of information (e.g., news, gossip, and entertainment) that are propagated differently. We then turn our attention to identifying classes of Twitter users, defining different types of users based on the type of information they seek and propagate. Finally, we combine these classifications of information and users in order to determine the extent to which community structure and composition in the Twitter online network is determined by preferences for information and information propagation.</p>
