<p class=MsoPlainText>The fact that strong ties are more likely to persist than weak ties is a well established finding in the study of human social networks. Balance theory suggests that reciprocity is also an important contributor to tie persistence. Here we consider the empirical implications of thinking of both tie strength and dyadic reciprocity as joint contributors to the survival of social ties. We note that if tie persistence is conditioned by both strength and reciprocity, those dyads more likely to be connected by weak ties---such as degree-dissimilar dyads---should also be characterized by greater than average reciprocity. We refer to this as the reciprocity of weak ties hypothesis. We consider data from a weighted human communication network constructed from information on cellular telephone voice calls and show that, as expected, degree-dissimilar dyads are both more likely to be connected by weak ties and they are more reciprocal than average. This is contrast to low-degree assortative dyads, which exhibit relatively higher levels of non-reciprocity, even as the ties that connect them are stronger. High-degree assortative dyads on the other hand, exhibit both high levels of reciprocity and high levels of strength.</p>
