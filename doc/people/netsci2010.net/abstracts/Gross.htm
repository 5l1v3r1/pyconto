<p class=MsoPlainText>In adaptive networks, the network topology coevolves with dynamics taking place on the network. In this talk I will present a simple models that describes the formation of adaptive networks of collaboration between agents. In contrast to many current works we allow agents to continuously and selectively tune the amount of resources that they invest into the collaboration with every specific other agents. The evolving patter of collaborations is therefore a complex, directed, weighted network of investments. Despite its complexity many properties of this network can be computed analytically. In particular we show that, starting from a homogeneous situation in which all agents are identical, a complex network forms in which the agents of high centrality extract more payoff than peripheral agents. Nevertheless, the agents coordinate their cooperative investment such that all agents invest the same total amount of resources, while maintaining a different number of connections.</p>
