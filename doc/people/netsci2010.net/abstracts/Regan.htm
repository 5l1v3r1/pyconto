<p class=MsoPlainText>The cell is a complex information processing system which responds to a combinatorial array of external stimuli. It receives, stores and processes information from its environment to generate behaviors (functional choices) best suited for its survival. In spite of the overwhelming amount of information detailing its inner workings, there exists an ongoing gap between studies of localized gene- and pathway-centered phenomena and system-level cellular phenotypes. Closing this gap requires defining and modeling biological function at multiple scales. Here I argue that the emergence of function within the dynamical regulatory network of the cell can be modeled using simple building blocks tied together in a hierarchical fashion. These building blocks are structural network modules with stable dynamical features, identifiable as functional states, which interact via simple functional relationships. Further we show that detailed prior knowledge of these structural regulatory modules is not required for the identification of functional cellular states. To this end a two-pronged approach is used. On one hand, a methodology is proposed to infer the hierarchical, modular structure of cellular regulatory networks from gene expression data. This methodology is rooted in basic assumptions about the signatures left by a hierarchically modular regulatory network on the expression states cells visit under a variety of conditions. On the other hand, a hypothetical functional landscape is proposed to describe the diversity of states endothelial cells can physiologically access using qualitative knowledge of their observed phenotypes. The two approaches are complementary in that the later provides a guide and test for functional assignment of states inferred form microarray data. At the same time, the hypothetical map is itself enriched by the former, unbiased approach.</p>
