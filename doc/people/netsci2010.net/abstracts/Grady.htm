<p class=MsoPlainText>We introduce the idea of computing a network's tomogram by examining shortest-path trees, analogous to the illustration of organ anatomy using pictures of tissue slices taken at various depths. Doing so allows us to measure global properties of a network conditioned on a starting location. Using the notion of similarity of shortest-path trees leads to a method of extracting a network 'backbone' and to a new method of identifying community structure based on clustering nodes with similar topological footprints. This new method produces a unique grouping and is more computationally efficient than other popular approaches. We applied these techniques to a multi-scale human mobility network obtained from the dollar-bill-tracking site wheresgeorge.com and to the U.S. and world-wide air transportation network.</p>
