<p class=MsoPlainText>Link-node graph models can be 'pinned down' to geographic space, where nodes represent physical locations or contextual places and links represent volume of connectivity between interacting entities. We can quantify interaction with 'analog' transactions: commuter and migration flows, postal deliveries and goods flows. These interactions can also be quantified by 'digital' transactions like telephone calls, emails, web page visits, or money transfers. Mapping these flows has been a topic in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis for nearly three decades, but flow maps are single, directed edges that link two nodes. Instead, GIS analysis has used traditional Euclidean and cost-based distance to determine the probability of inter-place connectivity. Distance alone does not capture the full relationship between entities in the built environment because it does not measure strength of interaction between entities, show multi-node flows, network traversal, diffusion paths, percolation, cliques and clusters. Although people are the actors in this system, could every distinguishable place in the world be connected by 6.6 steps? Simulating these connections as a network model allows us to uncover relationships that may gone otherwise unseen. For example, we can see major stakeholders in a city by their network centrality. We can also find places with similar behavior and extroversion characteristics by recognizing network motifs. Additionally, we can find spatial clusters with community detection methods. Network metrics, models and methods, than simply where they exist.</p>
