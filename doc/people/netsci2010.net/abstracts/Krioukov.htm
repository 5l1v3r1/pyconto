<p class=MsoPlainText>We establish a connection between the heterogeneous topology of complex networks, and the hyperbolic geometry of hidden metric spaces underlying these networks. Given a hyperbolic space, heterogeneous networks with strong clustering naturally emerge on top of the space as topological reflections of its geometry. Conversely, for any heterogeneous network with strong clustering, there is an effective hyperbolic space underlying the network. Fermi-Dirac statistics is the statistics of network edges in these settings, where the energy of an edge is the hyperbolic distance between the nodes connected by the edge, the strength of clustering in a network is a function of temperature, and the hyperbolic space curvature controls network heterogeneity. This framework allows one to study transport and communication processes on networks using only local information. We show that the efficiency of such processes achieves its theoretical maximum on complex networks only if the underlying space is hyperbolic.</p>
