<p class=MsoPlainText>Degree-based graph construction is an ubiquitous problem in network modeling, ranging from social sciences through chemical compounds to biochemical reaction networks in the cell. While there are a number of heuristic methods to graph construction, here I present rigorous results [1] that allows exact and independent sampling [2] from the set of all labeled graphs realizing a given degree sequence. We show that, while the samples are constructed non-uniformly, their exact weight can be determined, which in turn can be used to produce averages of network observables, as if they were measured on uniformly sampled realizations.
