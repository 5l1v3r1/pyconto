<p class=MsoPlainText>The Community Question has been one of the central debates in sociology. Historically there are three perspectives about the Question: arguments that communities are declining, are maintained, or are networked. This paper evaluates these arguments by modeling the prevalence of local vs. non-local social ties. We contend that the main weaknesses of these arguments result from the unidimensional view of urbanization and limited quantitative data. Based on data of a European mobile phone company, we reach three conclusions: 1) Urbanization is a multi-dimensional process and the various dimensions of urbanization have different effects on the extent and character of local and non-local social ties; 2) Self-selected, voluntary and non-place-bound social are important, but geospatial variations still shape social networks; and 3) A "ceiling" effect exists: prevalent social ties are relatively weak while rare social ties are relatively strong.</p>
