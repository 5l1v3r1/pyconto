<p class=MsoPlainText>During the last decade, the idea of Complex Networks has successfully been applied to a wide range of scientific fields. The research on Complex Networks begun with the effort of defining new concepts and measures to characterize topology of real networks. Recently, many models and technics have developed to understand and predict the behavior and dynamics of those systems. In this paper, we study transport in Complex Networks, and discuss the implications of our findings in natural systems.</p>
