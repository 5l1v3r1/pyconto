<p class=MsoPlainText>We examine data from a seminal study of an artificial cultural market (Salganik et al., Science, 2006), and develop a simple model that can explain seemingly complex empirical outcomes. Our results suggest that individual behavior is characterized by a two-step process -- the decision to listen to and the decision to download a song -- with social influence material to the first step only. A Pólya model of user behavior accurately fits empirical data but predicts a phenomenon not observed in prior experiments: after an initial period of feedback propelling the rise of arbitrary songs, those songs preferred by users will eventually recover market share. Our model clarifies the mechanism of socially mediated signals, and suggests that in the present market, social influence serves an informational rather than normative role.</p>
