<p class=MsoPlainText>The study of corporate control has neglected so far the international network of ownership and has not evaluated to what extent control is concentrated. In this work, we present an extensive analysis of control in the network surrounding transnational corporations world wide. We show that most of the economic actors are organized hierarchically in one giant structure, where control is distributed even more unequally than economic value. A large portion of control flows to a small tightly-knit core of mainly Anglo-Saxon financial institutions, which collectively hold shares in each other. This core can be seen as a ``super-entity'', raising issues for economic policies in a global market.</p>
