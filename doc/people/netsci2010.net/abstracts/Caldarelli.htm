<p class=MsoPlainText>This work investigate the emergence of systemic risk in a financial network, but the results apply more in general to a system of interdependent units in which each unit experience a positive feedback on its fragility. We characterize the evolution over time of a network of credit relations among financial agents as a system of coupled stochastic processes. Each process describes the dynamics of individual financial robustness, while the coupling results from a network of liabilities among agents. In addition, we also consider a discrete process of default cascade, due to the re-evaluation of agents assets. In this framework we investigate the probability of individual defaults as well as the probability of systemic default as a function of the network density. While it is usually thought that diversification of risk always leads to a more stable financial system, in our model a tension emerges between individual risk and systemic risk. As the number of counterparties in the credit network increases beyond a certain value, the default probability, both individual and systemic, starts to increase. In addition to the analytical results, further results, based on simulations, concern heterogeneous network structures, such as scale free and modular networks. The results offer a simple possible explanation for the endogenous emergence of systemic risk not only in financial networks but also in other complex networks. Part of the presentation will be based on the working paper available at http://www.nber.org/authors/stefano_battiston</p>
